### Hi ! I'm Erika and I'm a french student in Web Development and webDesign 👋

I received my first computer at the age of 10, and ever since, I knew I wanted to work in the field of new technologies.Over time and through various experiences, I decided to focus on developing my skills in web development. After a year of learning full-stack technologies, I furthered my journey by enrolling in the WebMarketing / WebDesign training program at the 3W Academy. 🎓

🚀 To fulfill my professional aspirations, I am actively seeking an apprenticeship position. I would be delighted to learn more about your project company !
