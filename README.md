### Hi ! I'm Erika and I'm a french student in Web Development👋

I received my first computer at the age of 10, and ever since, I knew I wanted to work in the field of new technologies. Over time and through various experiences, I decided to focus on developing my skills in web development. After a year of learning full-stack technologies, I furthered my journey by enrolling in a training program at the 3W Academy to become a web developer. 🎓

🚀 I'm actually doing my apprenticeship at Linagora !
